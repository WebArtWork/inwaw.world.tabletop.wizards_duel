# Game Rules (English)

## 1. Objective
Be the last wizard standing. The game ends when only one wizard remains alive.

## 2. Setup
- Players choose a school (Earth, Water, Fire, or Air).
- Each player starts with 0 spells, 0 weapons, and 0 mana.
- Place 3 dungeons on the table. Once a dungeon is completed, reveal the next one.

## 3. Gameplay
- Each round, players can choose to:
  1. Learn a spell from their school.
  2. Enter a dungeon to obtain a weapon.
  3. Attack another player in a duel.
- **Dungeons:** Players must overcome the dungeon’s HP using their spells. The first to defeat the dungeon’s HP claims the weapon.
- **Duels:** When a player attacks another, they enter a duel. If both players survive, the attacker loses their turn and cannot attack again that round.
- **Spells and Mana:** Players cast spells by consuming mana. Spells can be cast in any combination if the player has enough mana.

## 4. Resurrection
- Upon death, a player will resurrect after a certain number of rounds:
  - 1st Death: Resurrection after 1 round.
  - 2nd Death: Resurrection after 2 rounds.
  - 3rd Death: Resurrection after 3 rounds.
  - 4th Death: Resurrection after 4 rounds (similar next).
  - 5th Death: Permanently dead.
